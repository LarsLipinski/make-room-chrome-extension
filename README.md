# Make Room! Chrome Extension for Alexa Developers

This Chrome extension is a quick fix to help developers who are using the simulator test page in the Alexa Dev Console.
Currently the page is blocked by some clunky "personalisation" boxes that can't be closed if not used.
This extension makes room for the request/response output by removing the personalisation section, if personalisation is disabled.

## Installation

As this extension is likely to become broken or useless as soon as the page layout of the Alexa Dev Console evolves, I decided not to submit it to the Chrome Web Store.
So you've got to download the extension from this repo and install it manually:

- clone or download this repo from GitHub
- unpack the downloaded .zip
- open extensions manager in Chrome (you can use this link as shortcut: chrome://extensions/ )
- maybe you have to activate the option "Developer mode" in upper right corner of Chrome
- then you should see a button "Load unpacked" to select and load the unzipped folder into the browser

## Hints
Use on your own risk, it's not tested with all kind of other extensions or configurations.
This extension has been developed as a personal quick fix and is not endorsed by or affiliated with Amazon in any way.
